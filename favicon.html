    <h3 style="background-color:White;color:Black">World War I, often abbreviated as 
    WWI, also known as the Great War, was one of the deadliest global conflicts in 
    history.</h3>
    <h3 style="background-color:Pink;color:maroon"></h3>
    <h3 style="background-color:Pink;color:maroon"> Who fought in WW1?</h3>
    <h4 style="background-color:Pink;color:maroon">Over 30 nations declared war between 1914 and 1918.
    The majority joined on the side of the
    Allies, including Serbia, Russia, France, Britain, Italy and the United States.
    They were opposed by Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire,
    who together formed the Central Powers.</h4>
    <h3 style="background-color:skyblue;color:navyblue">Why did the US enter ww1?</h3>
    <h4 style="background-color:skyblue;color:navyblue">The United States later
    declared war on German ally Austria-Hungary on December 7, 1917. Germany's
    resumption of submarine attacks on passenger and merchant ships in 1917 became
    the primary motivation behind Wilson's decision to lead the United States into
    World War I.</h4>
    <h3 style="background-color:limegreen;color:darkgreen"> Why did Germany start ww1?</h3>
    <h4 style="background-color:limegreen;color:darkgreen">Germany sought to break up 
    the French-Russian alliance and was fully prepared to take the
    risk that this would bring about a major war. Some in the German 
    elite welcomed the prospect of beginning an expansionist war of conquest. 
    The response of Russia, France and later Britain were reactive and defensive.</h4>
